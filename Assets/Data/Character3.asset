    - Let's get down to business.
    - 'I had a meeting with Bob from the Art department earlier today and he told
      me I should fire you. '
    - He insists that you broke into the studios last night and glued googly eyes
      on all their character sketches.
    - 'Let me ask you this: should I fire Bob? '
    responses:
    - gesture: 0
      response:
      - Yes, yes! I should fire Bob.
      - We have no space for that kind of trash talk in this company, for making
        such damaging accusations against a coworker.
      - 'Also, between you and me, who even cares about the Art department? '

      - "But Bob\u2019s a big loser, I saw it clearly written on his back. "
      - "So I\u2019ll fire him just the same."

      - "I\u2019m in charge here, and the quality of my propositions should not be
        questioned by lame inferiors like you."
      - Also, I hate your shirt.

    - Ok, one last question for you.
    - Before I let you go back to work.
